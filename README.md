# Wine-Review
A wine review provides an evaluation of a wine’s aroma, taste, texture, and overall experience. It highlights key flavor notes such as fruity, floral, spicy, or oaky elements, describing the wine’s complexity and balance. The review also assesses the wine’s body, acidity, tannins, and finish, which contribute to its structure and mouthfeel.
